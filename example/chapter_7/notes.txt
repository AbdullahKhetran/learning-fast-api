--> Django

Django is bigger and more complex than Flask or FastAPI.
Its built-in object-relational mapper (ORM) is useful for sites with major database backends
More of a monolith than a toolkit


Django defines routes in a single `URLConf` table rather than using decoraters.
This makes it easier to see all routes in one place, but makes it harder tosee what URL is associated the funtion that you are looking at

Whether the extra complexity and learning curve are justified depends on your application.
