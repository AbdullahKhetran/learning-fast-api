We will be creating a medium-sized web service to access and manage data.

Full service will have 3 layers:
1. Web: the web interface
2. Service: the busiess logic
3. Data: the precious DNA of the whole thing

Web service will have these cross-layer components:
1. Model: Pydantic data definations 
2. Tests: Unit, integration, and end-to-end tests


Our Application will allow access to manage data about `cryptids` and `explorers`
- Retrieve
- Create
- Modify
- Replace
- Delete

useful command: `$ export PYTHONPATH=$PWD/src`
