RESTful desgins have these core components

Resources
    The data elements your application manages
IDs
    Unique resource identifiers
URLs
    Structured resource and ID strings

Verbs or actions
    Terms that accompany URLs for different purposes:
    GET
        Retrieve a resource.
    POST
        Create a new resource.
    PUT
        Completely replace a resource.
    PATCH
        Partially replace a resource.
    DELETE
        Resource goes kaboom.


Rules for combining them
verb /resource/
    Apply verb to all resources of type resource.
verb /resource/id
    Apply verb to the resource with ID id.


Web request may carry more insturction to:
- sort results
- paginate results
- perform other functions

Parameter for these are often included as query parameters (?name=john)
Large requests are included in HTTP body because URLs have size limits

** Singulare naming scheme will be used instead of plural **
